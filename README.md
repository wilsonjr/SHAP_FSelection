# SHAP-Selection: Selecting feature using SHAP values

Due to the increasing concerns about machine learning interpretability, we believe that interpretation must be added also to the pre-processing steps. Using this library, you will be able to select the most important features from a multidimensional dataset while being able to explain your decisions!

To use SHAP-Selection, you will need:
  * [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

## Usage 

To use SHAP-Selection, you must have a trained model. It works both for classification and regression purposes!

##### Load a dataset

```python
iris_data = load_iris()

X, y = iris_data.data, iris_data.target
feature_names = np.array(iris_data.feature_names)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```

##### Fit a model

```python
model = cb.CatBoostClassifier(verbose=False)    
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

##### Use SHAP-Selection

```python
# please, use agnostic = True to use with any model...
# agnostic = True will only work with tree-based models
from shap_selection import feature_selection

feature_order = feature_selection.shap_select(model, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, feature_names, agnostic=False)
```
